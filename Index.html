            <div class="a">
                <p class="p-1">
                    Located in Central Myanmar, only 4 hours away from Mandalay, Bagan is one of the world’s greatest
                    archaeological sites. Visit this amazing historical town hosting more than 2,200 temples big and
                    small.
                    Set amongst thick greenery on the Ayeyarwady river basin with misty mountains at a distance, Bagan
                    will
                    surely enchant you with its mystical appearance. The temples rise above the canopy of trees,
                    presenting
                    a picture-perfect scenery to visitors.
                </p><br>

                <p class="p-2">Bagan was the first capital of the Pagan Kingdom between the 9th to 13th centuries. More
                    than
                    10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed during the most flourishing days
                    of
                    the Kingdom between the 11th to 13th centuries. Today, around 2,200 temples and pagodas still
                    survive
                    and are carefully looked after by the government</p><br><br>
                <p class="p-3">The temples are a part of Bagan Archaeological Zone. They contain carvings, frescos and
                    statues of Buddha, which are certainly mesmerising and fun to explore.</p><br><br>
                <p class="p-4">Out of the 2,200 sites, only a few are regularly visited. Being the country’s
                    foremost tourist destination, Bagan has innumerable licensed tourist transport services to help
                    tourists
                    enjoy this beautiful site.</p><br><br>
                <p class="p-5">
                    Apart from the temples, visitors can also enjoy a leisure trip on the Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar’s
                    lifeline. </p><br><br>
                <p class="p-6">Take a cruise from Mandalay to Bagan and enjoy the riparian vegetation, the soothing
                    river
                    breeze and not to mention the sights and sounds of life along the river. You will also be able to
                    indulge in the fascinating views of Mt. Sagaing, Pakokku, Myingyan and other sites along the way.

                History tells us that Bagan was founded in the 2nd Century AD and fortified in 849AD by King Pyinbya, a
                successor of the founder of Bagan. The city was the capital of the Pagan Empire from 1044 to 1287.
                During this time, the rulers and wealthy subjects constructed more than 10,000 religious monuments. The
                city prospered during this time and grew in size. It was centre for secular and religious studies. The
                Pagan empire collapsed in 1287.

                <p class="p.p-1">
                    Bagan is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. Explore the ancient monuments of
                    different periods spread all across the city. These monuments stretch over a vast area on the bank
                    of
                    Ayeyarwady river up to the Turintaung range. Although the best way to explore these temples is by
                    foot,
                    a unique idea to enjoy a panoramic view of the Bagan temples is by taking a
                    ride on a hot air balloon. Taking this ride during sunrise and sunset is the icing on the cake and
                    we
                    highly recommend that. Those who are not keen to take a balloon ride need not get disappointed. You
                    can
                    simply climb up to the top terrace of the Bagan viewing tower and enjoy the wide expanse of temples
                </p><br>

                <p class="p.p-2">
                    The town is not only about temples. You should also take a cruise down the Ayeyarwady river and
                    enjoy
                    the scenic sunset. The river, the heartline of Myanmar has breathtaking views which should not be
                    missed. You can also take a boat ride between Mandalay and Bagan and enjoy the view

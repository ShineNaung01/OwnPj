This graceful temple is also known as the "Westminster Abbey of Burma", for its elegant and symmetrical design. The golden spire on top can be seen from miles across the Bagan Plain and is lit up at night by spotlights, creating a beacon in the sky. The temple itself is well-known for its four gold-leaf Buddha statues, each standing an impressive 30 feet tall.

Shwesandaw Pagoda is one of the most impressive temples in Bagan. Standing at 328 feet tall, it is visible from a great distance. The Pagoda itself is different from the usual golden bell shape seen in Myanmar. Instead, Shwesandaw has two octagonal bases and five square terraces, each topped with a stupa.

An important center for prayer and reflection, the Shwezigon Pagoda is an excellent place for interacting with locals as they come to worship. It has a classical golden bell shape and was one of the first of its kind to be constructed. After it was built, Shwezigon became the model for all subsequent pagodas in Myanmar.

The most frequently-visited temple in Bagan, the Sulamani Temple was built by King Narapatisihu, who found a small ruby on the ground on the Bagan Plains and built a temple in its place. The word Sulamani means "small ruby" and is a fitting name for this sand-orange and elegant "crowning jewel".


Known for containing the oldest original paintings in Bagan, Gubyaukgyi Temple is a must-see for lovers of art, beauty, and history alike. The temple's exterior is Indian-influenced in its architecture, with an elegant spire on top.
